# Marketplace-Price-Prediction-using-NLP-and-LSH

## Description

As a method to scale the prediction of products on marketplaces such as Amazon, we build an LSH pipeline to handle heavy recommendation ML techniques hidden within probabilistic algorithms, which, at a high probability, provides a recommendation close to its original algorithm. We showcase MinHash, modeling Jaccard Similarity, and SimHash, modeling Cosine Similarity on Embeddings.

## How to use

Open the ipynb on Jupyter Server and run it. The notebook should be self-explanatory to use.
